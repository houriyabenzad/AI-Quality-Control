1. Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of an automated quality control system for automotive parts using industrial computer vision and embedded AI.
The goal was to detect defects and non-conforming parts in real time on a production line, reducing human inspection errors and improving manufacturing efficiency.

The solution combines:

Deep Learning (YOLO), Edge AI deployment, Embedded systems, Hardware/Software integration

2. System Architecture

- The system is composed of:

- Industrial camera for image acquisition

- Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8L accelerator

- YOLO deep learning model 

- Industrial HMI for visualization and control

3. AI & Computer Vision

- Dataset prepared from real production images

- Labeled data used to train a YOLO model

- Model trained and optimized on GPU

- Converted and deployed for Edge AI inference on Hailo-8L

- Real-time detection with high accuracy and low latency

4. Results Achieved

- Automated 100% visual inspection of parts

- Real-time detection of defective components

- Reduced manual inspection

- Improved quality consistency
